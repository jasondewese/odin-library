# odin-library
A simple library app that is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The project is meant as an exercise in object constructors and prototypes in JavaScript. 

## What I learned
- Creating and initializing objects based on a constructor function
- Creating new html elements and appending them into the DOM for dynamic display
- Removing elements from the DOM dynamically
- Auto-fit grid columns for layout wrapping and auto fitting to different screen sizes
- Creating a pop-up style form to collect info
- Graying out screen behind pop-up to create focus on the form
